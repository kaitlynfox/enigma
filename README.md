<h1>Enigma: Self-Assessment</h1>

<h2>Functionality</h2>
Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented.
Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented.

<p>To the best of my ability, I have implemented both the encrypt and
decrypt methods to successfully encrypt a message and then decrypt that same
message using the key and date initially used.</p>  



<h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
<p>Project is broken into logical components that are appropriately
encapsulated. No classes are unreasonably small or large, or contain
knowledge, information/behavior that they shouldnâ€™t know about. Student can
articulate the single responsibilities of the various components.</p>

<p>I have learned an incredible amount during this project. I struggled quite a
bit during the paired and group projects just trying to keep up and
contribute in anyway that I could, which was quite limited at the time.
Although I wasn't able to contribute as much as I would have liked during
those projects, being able to sit down without any distractions for an
extended amount of time really gave me the opportunity to break things and
really understand how and why things work together the way that they do. I
have improved my ability to break down larger components/methods into
helper methods (I had zero idea how to do this in the paired project and
going through most of the group project), and I have been able to refactor
more as I have become more familiar with coding in general. I am better at
identifying information that should be encapsulated but am still not as
proficient as I would like to be and is something that I am working on.</p>



<h2>Ruby Conventions and Mechanics</h2>
Code is mostly properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long.
Class, method, variable, and file names follow convention. Some enumerables,
data structures chosen are the most efficient tool for a given job, and
students can speak as to why those enumerables/data structures were chosen.
At least one hash is implemented in a way that makes logical sense.

<p>Code is mostly properly indented and spaced. I do have a couple of lines
that are a bit longer than I'd like, but at this current moment, I have
found it extremely helpful to have names that might be a bit long but very
descriptive to help myself be able to follow and understand what it was
that I was intending to do and what I was intending to store. I do understand
that I will need to do better in this arena and that my variable and method
names can be shorter in length and still be descriptive. I have done my best
to use enumerables that are the most logical/efficient for the task at hand.
I have been holding back on using enumerables that I am not as comfortable
with but have tried to push myself out of my comfort zone and be a bit more
willing to try something I wouldn't normally default to (ex, placed offsets
into a hash).</p>



<h2>Test Driven Development</h2>
Every method is tested at both the unit and integration level, and completely
verify expected behavior (i.e., if a single method does 3 things, all 3
things are explicitly tested). Obvious edge cases are addressed. git history
demonstrates students are writing tests before implementation code. Test
coverage metrics show coverage at 99% or greater.

<p>SimpleCov is another tool that I was really unsure of when working in the
group project. Now that I have had the chance to really work with it and see
how it can be utilized to help me when testing, I have found it to be very
helpful. It is great to be able to open up a page to see what files are
needing attention, and the most helpful, being able to see specifically
what lines. I have been able to keep the test coverage up above 99%. Tests
have been a priority when doing this project, and I have done my best to write
tests prior to implementing code.</p>



<h2>Version Control</h2>
A passing project will have a minimum of 30 commits, and uses a pull request
workflow that includes related and logical functionality.

<p>I was able to reach the minimum of 30 commits and also created pull requests
to merge to main.</p>
